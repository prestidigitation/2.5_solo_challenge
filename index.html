<h1>The great horned owl is the coolest owl of them all!</h1>
<p>This is a website about the great horned owl (GHO), also referred to as the tiger owl.</p>
<hr>
<p>GHOs sure are early birds, since they are among the earliest nesting birds in North America, and usually lay eggs weeks or even months before other raptorial (carnivorous birds that hunt and kill other animals) birds.</p>
