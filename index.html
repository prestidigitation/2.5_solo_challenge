<h1>The great horned owl is the coolest owl of them all!</h1>
<p>This is a website about the great horned owl (GHO), also referred to as the tiger owl.</p>
<hr>
<p>GHOs sure are early birds, since they are among the earliest nesting birds in North America, and usually lay eggs weeks or even months before other raptorial birds. Raptors are carnivorous aves that hunt and kill other animals.</p>

<p>I checked out the National Geographic page on GHOs, <a href="http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/great-horned-owl/">here</a>. The site has decent layout but also seems to leave a lot of screen real estate unused. It seems that the convention is to use em and strong to represent italics and bold, rather than the b and i elements. The html elements are tightly integrated with javascript code, which I need to learn more of.</p>
